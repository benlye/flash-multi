# About Flash Multi
Flash Multi is an application for managing the firmware on a Jumper, iRangeX, Vantac, 'Banggood', or DIY MULTI-Module.  A GUI application is available for Windows and a shell script for Linux and macOS.

Flash Multi can read the existing firmware, save a backup, and write new firmware.

For STM32 modules, firmware read/write operations can be performed using the built-in USB connection or via an external USB-to-serial adapter.  For ATmega328p modules a USBasp programmer is required.

Just three steps are required to update your Jumper, iRangeX, or DIY MULTI-Module (full instructions are below):
1. [Download and install](#installing-flash-multi) Flash Multi and any required [device drivers](#additional-drivers)
1. Download the appropriate [MULTI-Module firmware file](https://downloads.multi-module.org/)
1. [Write](#using-flash-multi) the new firmware to your module

# Supported MULTI-Modules
All MULTI-Module based on the STM32 or ATmega328p microcontrollers are supported.  OrangeRX modules are _not_ supported (yet).

Supported modules include:
* Jumper JP4IN1 and JP4IN1-SE
* Jumper T16 Pro internal modules - **only with a USB-to-serial adapter**
* iRangeX IRX4, IRX4 Plus, and IRX4 Lite
* Vantac MPM Lite
* 'Banggood' STM32 and ATmega328p MULTI-Modules
* DIY STM32 and ATmega328p MULTI-Modules

## Note for Jumper T16 Pro Owners
**Flash Multi cannot be used to update the internal module in a Jumper T16 by connecting to the radio's USB port.**

If your internal module has MULTI-Module firmware v1.2.1.85 or newer, and the radio is running OpenTX v2.3.2 or newer, you can update the internal module from the radio using [this process](https://www.multi-module.org/using-the-module/firmware-updates/update-methods#opentx).

If your MULTI-Module has MULTI-Module firmware v1.2.1.51 you must use Flash Multi and a USB-to-serial adapter to update it one time, as explained [here](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?3428887-Jumper-T16-Internal-Multiprotocol-Module-Firmware-Update).  Subsequent updates can then be installed from the radio.

# Flash Multi Requirements
Flash Multi requires .Net Framework 4.5 or newer.  You probably already have a compatible version installed, but if not, the latest version can be downloaded from [Microsoft](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework).
> _Tip: When you launch Flash Multi it will tell you if you need to install or upgrade your .Net Framework._

# Installing Flash Multi
## Windows

1. Download `flash-multi-[version].zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/benlye/flash-multi/releases/latest)
1. Unzip the zip file to a convenient location
1. Launch the application by running `flash-multi.exe`

### Additional Drivers
**Depending on your MULTI-Module and version of Windows you may need to install additional drivers manually.**

#### Maple USB
The Maple USB driver, which is used by many MULTI-Modules, including original Jumper JP4IN1 modules, iRangeX IRX4 and IRX4+ modules, and all Banggood STM32 modules, can be installed using the driver installer which is included with Flash Multi.

**Note:** Make sure your MULTI-Module is not plugged in when you run the Maple USB driver installer.  This is to avoid potential problems with the driver installation.

1. Locate the folder where you unzipped Flash Multi
1. Run `\drivers\install_drivers.bat` to install the Maple USB device drivers

#### Jumper JP4IN1-SE
The driver for the Jumper JP4IN1 module, the Silicon Labs CP210x driver, is **not** included with Flash Multi and can be downloaded from here:
https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers

Other drivers may be needed if you are using an external USB-to-serial adapter. Consult the documentation for your adapter.

*Windows 10 includes drivers for many common serial devices, including many USB-to-serial adapters, so check Device Manager to see if your device is recognised.*

## Linux and Mac
Please refer to the [Linux and macOS instructions](doc/Linux.md).

# Using Flash Multi
**Note:** The first time you flash your module you may need to connect it with an external USB-to-serial adapter in order to flash the bootloader. The bootloader is required in order for the native USB port work, and it can only be written with a USB-to-serial adapter.  This does not apply to newer Jumper 4IN1 modules, which have an _internal_ USB-to-serial adapter.

**Note for external USB-to-serial connections:** When using an external USB-to-serial adapter, the `BOOT0` pin on the board must be connected to 3.3V, usually by installing a jumper on the `BOOT0` header pins.

1. If the module is installed in the radio and you are connecting to the module's USB port, ensure the radio is powered **off**
1. Launch **Flash Multi**
1. Connect your module to the computer using the module's USB port, an external USB-to-serial adapter, or a USBasp device (ATmega328p modules only), as appropriate
   > _Tip: Flash Multi will automatically select the new COM port / device, if it's running when the module is plugged in._
1. Click the **Browse** button and select a compiled firmware file
1. If it wasn't automatically selected, select the appropriate COM port or device
1. Click the **Upload** button

## Writing the Bootloader
The bootloader enables flashing the MULTI-Module firmware from a radio which supports this (see [here](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/docs/Flash_from_Tx.md)).  It also enables the native USB port on MULTI-Modules which have one, facilitating firmware updates via native USB rather than an external USB-to-serial adapter.

When flashing with a USB-to-serial adapter the bootloader will be written automatically if the selected firmware file was compiled with support for it.

When flashing via the native USB port the firmware being flashed _must be compiled with support for the bootloader_ otherwise, to avoid rendering the module inoperable, Flash Multi will display an error and stop the flash attempt.

## Upload Output
The output will vary depending on the type of module being flashed.

Modules connected via an external USB-to-serial adapter, and the Jumper JP4IN1 module (which has an *internal* USB-to-serial adapter behind the USB port) will see output like this:
```
Starting MULTI-Module update
[1/3] Erasing flash memory... done
[2/3] Writing bootloader... done
[3/3] Writing MULTI-Module firmware... done

MULTI-Module updated sucessfully
```

> _Note: Step 2, writing the bootloader, is not performed when writing firmware which was not compiled with support for the native USB / Flash from TX bootloader._

Modules connected via USB (except the Jumper JP4IN1) will see output like this:
```
Maple device found in USB mode
Starting MULTI-Module update
Switching MULTI-Module into DFU mode ... done
Waiting for DFU device ... got it
Writing firmware to MULTI-Module ... done

MULTI-Module updated sucessfully
```

For both methods, if the 'Show Verbose Output' box is checked the actual output from each of the flash proceses will be shown. If the flash fails for any reason the verbose messages are a good place to look for more details.

# MULTI-Module Firmware
Pre-compiled MULTI-Module firmware can be downloaded from [https://downloads.multi-module.org/](https://downloads.multi-module.org/).

The MULTI-Module firmware can also be [compiled from source](https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/docs/Compiling_STM32.md) relatively easily.

# Troubleshooting
See the dedicated [Troubleshooting page](doc/Troubleshooting.md).

# More Information
Much more information about flashing a MULTI-Module, including how to connect a USB-to-serial adapter and connect the `BOOT0` pin, can be found in the documentation for the MULTI-Module at https://github.com/pascallanger/DIY-Multiprotocol-TX-Module/blob/master/README.md.

# Warranty
Flash Multi is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
