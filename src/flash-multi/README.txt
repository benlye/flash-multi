Flash Multi Readme
==============================

1. MULTI-Module Drivers

The Flash Multi installer only installs USB and DFU mode drivers for 
the native 'Maple' serial port (if they are selected).

If your version of Windows requires additional serial port drivers 
for your MULTI-Module, you will need to install those manually.

See the Flash Multi documentation for more information.
